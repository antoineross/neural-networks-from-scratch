# neural-networks-from-scratch
This is dedicated to learning neural networks from scratch based on the open source lecture by Andrej Karpathy. In this lecture I was able to understand backpropogation more intuitively.
In this repository I will try to implement upon and further understand the micrograd built on the lecture.
